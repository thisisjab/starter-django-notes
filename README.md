# starter django notes
I saved some topics that I have learned from "Django for Beginners" book here. In this repo, I have covered these topics for myself:
- user authentication
- database crud
- templates
- urls
- static files
- whitenoise package
- database migration

This repo is archived, since no more commits or practice will be applied to this repo.
